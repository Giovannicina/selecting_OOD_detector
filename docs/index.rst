Welcome to the documentation for Selecting OOD Detector
==================================================

Your How-To Guide for OOD Detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is one of the crucial safety checks for reliable deployment of machine learning models.  However, while it is a standard practice to tailor predictive models to a specific task, there is no universal way of testing OOD detection methods in practice.

This repository allows you to test and tailor OOD detection methods to custom dataset and select the best OOD detector for your application.
